  Use the local dlexa CLI executable from `workspace/` and, when editing the
  Go code behind it, run and interpret the configured Go lint workflow for the
  dlexa CLI repository. Trigger: load when you need to execute `.\dlexa.exe`
  from `workspace/` for a dictionary-style lookup, or when reading, editing,
  reviewing, or validating Go code, packages, tests, or CLI behavior in this
  repo and lint feedback should shape the next change.

## When to Use

- When another skill, such as `diccionario`, needs a CLI-assisted lookup and it is convenient to run `.\dlexa.exe` from `workspace/`.
- When the current working directory is `workspace/` and the repo-local binary `./dlexa.exe` is available next to `skills/`.
- When touching any Go production code under `cmd/` or `internal/`.
- When changing Go tests and those changes affect package APIs, error handling, resource lifecycles, or allocations.
- When reviewing a Go diff and you need repo-accurate static analysis before calling the work done.
- When fixing bugs in code paths that may trigger `gosec`, `errcheck`, `bodyclose`, `staticcheck`, `govet`, `gocritic`, `revive`, or `prealloc`.
- Before finalizing a Go/CLI task in this repo. Do not skip lint because the change "looks small".

## Critical Patterns

- MUST execute the repo-local binary as `.\dlexa.exe` from `workspace/` when the goal is to query the CLI, instead of assuming some globally installed command or inventing results.
- MUST treat CLI output as lookup assistance, then ground any final answer in the evidence returned by the binary or the local reference files used by the calling skill.
- MUST use the repo-local tool module, not a globally installed binary. Canonical full-repo lint is `go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./...`, and the pre-commit hook stays diff-based with `go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run --new-from-rev=HEAD`.
- MUST lint after changing relevant Go code before claiming the task is complete.
- MUST prefer the smallest lint scope that still covers the changed behavior while iterating, then run broader lint when the change crosses packages or touches shared behavior.
- MUST run full repo lint when the change affects shared packages, exported APIs, cross-package flows, config used by many packages, or multiple packages at once.
- MUST re-run lint after fixing lint findings that can cascade into other warnings.
- MUST prioritize safety and correctness first: fix `gosec`, `govet`, `staticcheck`, `errcheck`, and `bodyclose` findings before style-only cleanup.
- MUST treat `bodyclose` and `errcheck` issues as real resource/correctness defects, not cosmetic warnings.
- MUST preserve performance-sensitive improvements surfaced by `prealloc` when they do not hurt readability or semantics.
- MUST NOT build as part of this skill. Use lint only.
- MUST NOT swap commands, flags, or config unless the repository itself changes its lint setup.

## Configured Linters

| Linter        | Why it matters                       | What to watch for                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gosec`       | Security and dangerous patterns      | Unsafe file/process/network handling, risky conversions, weak defaults |
| `govet`       | Compiler-adjacent correctness checks | Suspicious API usage, bad printf-style calls, logic mistakes           |
| `staticcheck` | Deep correctness and maintainability | Dead code, ineffective logic, misuse of stdlib APIs                    |
| `errcheck`    | Error handling discipline            | Ignored returned errors, especially IO and cleanup paths               |
| `bodyclose`   | Resource lifecycle safety            | HTTP response bodies that are not closed on every path                 |
| `gocritic`    | Robustness and code quality          | Dubious constructs, accidental inefficiencies, fragile patterns        |
| `revive`      | Style with maintainability impact    | Naming, structure, comments, and readability rules                     |
| `prealloc`    | Allocation awareness                 | Slices that should be preallocated in hot or predictable paths         |

## Lint Scope Decision Table

| Situation                                                          | Command                                                                                            | Why                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Editing one package only                                           | `go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./internal/query/...`                       | Fast feedback while iterating in one package boundary          |
| Editing `cmd/dlexa` only                                           | `go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./cmd/dlexa/...`                            | Keeps iteration tight around CLI entrypoint changes            |
| Editing 2-3 known packages                                         | `go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./internal/query/... ./internal/source/...` | Covers the touched package set without scanning the whole repo |
| Editing shared abstractions, exported APIs, or cross-package flows | `go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./...`                                      | Catches fallout across package boundaries                      |
| Finishing a Go task and ready to report done                       | `go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./...`                                      | Final repo-wide verification before handoff                    |
| Fixing lint findings after the first pass                          | Re-run the same scope first, then widen to `./...` if the change spread                            | Confirms the fix and catches secondary fallout                 |

## Simple Decision Tree

1. Did you change Go code outside one package? -> Run `./...`.
2. Did you change exactly one package and stay inside that boundary? -> Run that package path first.
3. Did the fix touch shared helpers, interfaces, exported symbols, or HTTP/resource handling? -> Escalate to `./...`.
4. Are you about to say the task is done? -> Run `./...` unless the task explicitly excluded final verification.

## Commands

```bash
# Run the local CLI from workspace/
.\dlexa.exe tilde
.\dlexa.exe hashtag

# Full repository lint
go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./...

# Lint one package under internal/
go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./internal/query/...

# Lint multiple known packages
go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./internal/query/... ./internal/source/...

# Lint the CLI entrypoint package
go tool --modfile=golangci-lint.mod golangci-lint run ./cmd/dlexa/...
```

## Operational Workflow

1. If the task is a lookup, run `.\dlexa.exe <consulta>` from `workspace/` and inspect the output before answering.
2. If the task changes Go code, map the changed Go files to package boundaries.
3. Run focused lint while iterating on the touched package or package set.
4. Fix findings in this order: security/correctness -> resource handling -> robustness -> maintainability -> performance.
5. Re-run the same focused scope until clean.
6. If the change crossed package boundaries or the task is complete, run `./...`.
7. Report which CLI query or lint scope was run and whether it passed cleanly.
